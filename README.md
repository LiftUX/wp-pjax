Wordpress plugin to add pjax

Read more about [pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax), right now the plugin calls pjax on the body element and we have wordpress serve up the page trimmed after the body element up until where the `wp_footer()` call.

#### Coming up

Easy way to filter the element pjax works on and filter the content that wordpress serves up.
